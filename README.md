## Approach and Significance of y
We saw the trend in the data that if y is 1 then Close is greater than Open for next day. So we checked it using Logistic regression and we got confident about our observation. So y here simply signifies the same.
If y=1, it is safe to invest next day or else, there is loss in buying stock next day.
